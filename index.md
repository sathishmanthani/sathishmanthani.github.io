[Predicting S&P 500 index price](/predict-sp500-index)

Predicting stock prices is a popular usecase for machine learning and predictive analytics. 
S&P 500 (Standard and Poor 500) is the stock market index that measures the stock performance of 500 large companies in the US.
In this project, I built models to predict the stock prices for it based on the available variables and historical data.
I used machine learning algorithms like Decision trees, Random forests, Gradient boosting, Neural networks, and Facebookâ€™s prophet in this project.
