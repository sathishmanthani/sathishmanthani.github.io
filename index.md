[Predicting S&P 500 index price](/predict-sp500-index)

Predicting stock prices is a popular usecase for machine learning and predictive analytics.
S&P 500 (Standard and Poor 500) is the stock market index that measures the stock performance of 500 large companies in the US. <br>
In this project, I built models to predict the stock prices for it based on the available variables and historical data.
I used machine learning algorithms like Decision trees, Random forests, Gradient boosting, Neural networks, and Facebookâ€™s prophet in this project. <br>

[NYC Airbnb Data Analysis](/airbnb-data-analysis)

Airbnb offers lodging, primarily homestays and tourism experiences. Just like Uber, the company does not own any of the real estate nor does it host any events. 
It acts as a middleman between the customer and the owner providing the accommodation and Airbnb receives commission from each booking.
Problem statement is to explore Airbnb cost in different areas of New York. What are the variables influencing the price of Airbnb stay. <br>
